# Tag Context - Design and Functionality

'Tags' are searchable keywords that maybe associated with a restaurant, dish or food product. These will belong to different categories e.g. `cuisines`, `restaurant_types`, `dining_options`, `flavours` and so on.

The context will be accessible to the web-app as read-only, whereas admin routes will be created for entire CRUD functionality. So the generator being used is `mix phx.gen.html` and not `mix.phx.gen.context`
